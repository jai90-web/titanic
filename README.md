<h2> is titanic really broken to flood underwater :</h2>

<p> The watertight compartments would remain undamaged. The ends of the transverse bulkheads of the watertight compartments were raised to prevent a tragedy similar to the Titanic. When the hull of the Titanic was torn open in the collision with the iceberg, water began to flood the damaged compartments in the bow. </p>
